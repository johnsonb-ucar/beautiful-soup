PROGRAM ``restart_file_tool``
=============================

Overview
--------

This tool still exists in the "Classic" release of DART but is no longer needed in the "Manhattan" release. DART initial
condition and restart files are now in NetCDF format and any standard NetCDF tool can be used to manipulate them.
