Radar Observations
==================

Overview
--------

Several programs for converting radar observations into DART obs_seq format exist, and will be placed in this directory
when they are ready for distribution. Observations generated by these programs have been successfully assimilated with
weather models in the DART framework.

This directory currently contains a program for generating synthetic radar observations for a `WSR-88D
(NEXRAD) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSR-88D>`__. It can generate reflectivity and/or doppler radial velocity
observations with clear-air or storm sweep patterns, for testing or for OSSEs (Observing System Simulation Experiments).

There are challenges to working with radar data; for more information contact us.

Programs
--------

``create_obs_radar_sequence`` generates one or more sets of synthetic radar observations. Change into the ``work``
subdirectory and run ``quickbuild.csh`` to build this program.

Many DART users working with radar observations are using the WRF Weather and Research Forecast model. See the `WRF
tests directory <../../../models/wrf/regression/Radar/README>`__ for pointers to data to run a radar test case.

In addition to the programs available in the DART distribution, the following external program produces DART observation
sequence files:

-  `Observation Processing And Wind Synthesis (OPAWS) <http://code.google.com/p/opaws/>`__: OPAWS can process NCAR
   Dorade (sweep) and NCAR EOL Foray (netcdf) radar data. It analyzes (grids) data in either two-dimensions (on the
   conical surface of each sweep) or three-dimensions (Cartesian). Analyses are output in netcdf, Vis5d, and/or DART
   (Data Assimilation Research Testbed) formats.
